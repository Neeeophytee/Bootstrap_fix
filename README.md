# Bootstrap_fix
I have seen people constantly making some mistakes when using Bootstrap. This is a fix to few of those.

# The Folder Tree
Create a folder with the component name and inside that folder put your html file.
### Example
`
Bootstrap_fix/bootstrap_component/your_file_name.html
`

# The Template

```
<!--Briefly but clearly explain what problem are you solving at the start of your file inside this commented area-->
<html>
<head>
<link href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<style>
<!--Your custom styling goes here-->
</style>
</head>
<body>
<!--Your html goes here-->
</body>
</html>

```
